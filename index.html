We talk about how he designs his own training, how coaching one sport translates to another, and what still drives his passion for Climbing after starting over 12 years ago. Evan continually calls this: "maybe our best episode yet." Come check it out!</p>

            <p>It's been a long time since we've uploaded an episode, but here's a new one.

          <h2>About this page</h2>
          <p class="lead">This podcast started when Zack discovered Evan's first podcast, the PadBros podcast. Evan had a great podcasting voice, but Zack, a non gamer, did not keep up with the game and much of the podcast was wasted on him. He asked Evan if he would do another podcast. They decided to do one about the climbing community in the South Bay (of San Francisco). Evan came up with the name, Zack found the space, and built the website and does most of the editing. If it feels like the podcast is only funny to Zack, that is mostly by design.</p>
