It's been a long time since we've uploaded an episode, but here's a new one. We have decided to shift the format up a bit and talk a bit more about finger issues and various other climbing performance suggestions before we go into our climbing updates. Hopefully the new format will provide a bit more structure and maybe fewer tangents.
